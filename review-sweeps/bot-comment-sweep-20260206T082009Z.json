After this change, any such event will be re-broadcast with a SHA computed from canonical bytes but payload bytes that hash differently, triggering `EventFrameError::HashMismatch` for subscribers and causing replication/apply failures. This only occurs when peers send non-canonical payloads, but those were accepted before; now the broadcast path should use the canonical payload you already computed.\n\nUseful?

      "body": "### Parent filter returns empty for tombstoned parent beads\n\n**Medium Severity**\n\n<!-- DESCRIPTION START -->\n`parent_edges_to` returns an empty vector when the parent bead is tombstoned (via the early `get_live(parent).is_none()` check), which changes the behavior of the parent filter in `list_issues`. The old code used raw `dep_indexes().in_edges()` which didn't check parent liveness, so querying children of a deleted epic would still return its live children. Now `children_of_parent` becomes `Some(empty_set)`, causing every bead to be filtered out and returning an empty list.\n<!-- DESCRIPTION END -->\n\n<!-- BUGBOT_BUG_ID: 53f28576-23bd-403d-aba7-c22b2ad1cf93 -->\n\n<!-- LOCATIONS START\ncrates/beads-core/src/state.rs#L1465-L1476\ncrates/beads-rs/src/daemon/query_executor.rs#L185-L192\nLOCATIONS END -->\n<details>\n<summary>Additional Locations (1)</summary>\n\n- [`crates/beads-rs/src/daemon/query_executor.rs#L185-L192`](https://github.com/delightful-ai/beads-rs/blob/fb89a784a562ccb173b30f6a60110c5fae679cac/crates/beads-rs/src/daemon/query_executor.rs#L185-L192)\n\n</details>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cursor.com/open?data=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImJ1Z2JvdC12MiJ9.eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxLCJ0eXBlIjoiQlVHQk9UX0ZJWF9JTl9DVVJTT1IiLCJkYXRhIjp7InJlZGlzS2V5IjoiYnVnYm90OmI5NWUxNjBjLTU0MmUtNDZjNy1hNTI0LWQ0NmI0Y2VmZWJlZCIsImVuY3J5cHRpb25LZXkiOiJtS2E4aDdYYjFDaEhYZGhnNmNqVkZkdE4xM1BKS3BLaEpDeUl1WFZNa1RJIiwiYnJhbmNoIjoicHIvMTItdmFsaWRhdGVkLWNvbW1hbmQtc3VyZmFjZSIsInJlcG9Pd25lciI6ImRlbGlnaHRmdWwtYWkiLCJyZXBvTmFtZSI6ImJlYWRzLXJzIn0sImlhdCI6MTc3MDM2NTk2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzcyOTU3OTY4fQ.M140Fd1lhEdbN9u-U4KnbEbnNq2Q6qFDDuOWYpgbw2zJd855ZAqnQpMsZ6pXkKNll4SY3DkfH4JiIlWvx1N9MPFDfH0XTpumwKaMXBLpQSsdlfPyYbr2xiOEEpfH7wUlQPJYQutCujGyWEB8KyBRf1sjqOHxJMQ5GNudUlC3cBDE_gZt1b_JaZQCYY6cq7ix6cwTAzb5jdgrEYLrbTbYnX1CylRZmlSz8NFjNt28-qrc3cgj1fHERMUx2gV9Gsx-XI_Ds5neGvbAf9BeQxSRJ50NQb4JXsXAWBaAO35B6VaRkGhwSIgn8Byi_E3KbMCbPlNwBD-VuNio83Yn44rBvg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><picture><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-cursor-dark.png\"><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-cursor-light.png\"><img alt=\"Fix in Cursor\" width=\"115\" height=\"28\" src=\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-cursor-dark.png\"></picture></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cursor.com/agents?data=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6ImJ1Z2JvdC12MiJ9.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.QF2rar9rpD3ODFM65ftyhkIXkVqbJce4TzTzLQtFynSePTwfuM8czXvFZd3X7lF4GQxqv0q72A7-EuGLFIzOpp08Jg3uz5ZFr6Gh20Uj2yvtPKr69e3aul0dh_3rK03sy6u_JTOvgR-Iln2qNsfpizxIPijs8pDKkulaYzQvPVpwhPtjdZVGynYZaBgmMRPMs3SKp2PvLDstkUvkUBwEsIcFBrBLh3lam9vnPYFicpfFG70ldQ8pGrIDKvqsENQOTDbe7jpyVw1tiizkazKmLmqIpdPCKYPQnGo2ZBnOu-iBLIerh4a2WxIBwnsrZsJYcnfhQnr3x-i9S4q0YUimVQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><picture><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-web-dark.png\"><source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-web-light.png\"><img alt=\"Fix in Web\" width=\"99\" height=\"28\" src=\"https://cursor.com/assets/images/fix-in-web-dark.png\"></picture></a></p>",

If a snapshot contains legacy lineage notes (e.g., from older ops with no lineage and no collision tombstone), those notes are loaded after the insert and never re-absorbed, so `bead_view` won\u2019t show them. This is a regression specific to snapshot import; consider setting the stores before `insert_live` or re-running `absorb_legacy_lineage` after loading notes/labels.\n\nUseful?

The v1 spec draft only declares that `WELCOME` carries a `welcome_nonce` (no echo requirement), so older peers that generate an independent welcome nonce will now be rejected as `invalid_request`, breaking mixed-version replication without a protocol bump or fallback. This will surface when a new outbound session connects to an older inbound peer that still follows the previous behavior. Consider gating the echo requirement on a new protocol version or accepting non-matching nonces for v1 compatibility.\n\nUseful? React with \ud83d\udc4d\u00a0/ \ud83d\udc4e.",
