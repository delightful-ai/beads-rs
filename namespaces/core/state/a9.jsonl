Current config only includes auto_upgrade + limits; replication uses env vars and checkpoint groups are hard-coded to core.\n\nEvidence:\n- src/config.rs: Config has only auto_upgrade + limits.\n- src/daemon/core.rs uses BD_REPL_LISTEN_ADDR / BD_REPL_MAX_CONNECTIONS env vars.\n- src/daemon/checkpoint_scheduler.rs uses core_default only; no config-backed groups.\n\n**Why this violates plan**\nThe plan explicitly calls out config-driven checkpoint groups and replication parameters. Missing config blocks real deployments and policy-driven behavior.\n\n**Acceptance**\n- [ ] Extend Config to include replication listen addr/peers/timeouts and checkpoint group definitions.\n- [ ] Load namespace policy defaults from config or namespaces.toml as specified.\n- [ ] Replace env-only replication settings with config precedence (env can override).\n- [ ] Tests cover config roundtrip + defaulting.","id":"bd-3m5.88","labels":{"cc":{"max":{}},"entries":{}},"priority":2,"status":"closed","title":"Config additions missing for replication/checkpoint/namespace defaults","type":"bug"}
