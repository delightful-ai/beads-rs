The `xtask` alias suggests functionality that doesn't exist.\n\n## Suggested Fix\nEither:\n1) Add an `xtask/` crate and wire a real coverage job, or\n2) Remove the alias and update .github/AGENTS.md to match reality.\n\n## Acceptance\n- CI docs accurately describe the workflows that actually run.\n- No dead `cargo xtask` alias unless backed by a crate.","id":"bd-zd0","labels":{"cc":{"max":{}},"entries":{}},"priority":3,"status":"closed","title":"CI docs drift: xtask/coverage references but no xtask crate","type":"chore"}
