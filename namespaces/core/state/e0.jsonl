Reparenting existing beads probably keeps their original ID rather than renumbering.\n\n**Acceptance**\n- [ ] `bd update <id> --parent <epic-id>` works\n- [ ] Invalid/deleted parent rejected with clear error\n- [ ] Circular parent reference rejected\n- [ ] Can unparent a bead (remove from epic)\n- [ ] `bd show` reflects new parent\n- [ ] `bd epic status` includes reparented beads","id":"bd-oi9","labels":[],"priority":2,"status":"closed","title":"Add --parent flag to bd update command","type":"feature"}
