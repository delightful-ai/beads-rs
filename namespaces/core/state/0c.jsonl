{"_at":[1767919327281,0],"_by":"darin@darinsmcstudio2.lan","assignee":"darin@darinsmacstudio.lan","created_at":[1767916519416,0],"created_by":"darin@darinsmcstudio2.lan","description":"**Problem**\nCLI handlers perform read-modify-write for labels and parent relationships. `src/cli/commands/label.rs` fetches each issue then sends a full `Update` patch, and `src/cli/commands/update.rs` queries deps then removes/adds parent edges. This makes changes non-atomic, adds round trips, and splits core behavior across CLI and daemon.\n\n**Design**\nAdd daemon-side ops for label and parent mutations and switch CLI to use them:\n- Extend IPC `Request` with `AddLabels { repo, id, labels: Vec<String> }` and `RemoveLabels { repo, id, labels: Vec<String> }`, or a single `UpdateLabels { add, remove }` request.\n- Add `SetParent { repo, id, parent: Option<String> }` that replaces existing parent edges in one mutation.\n- Implement handlers in `src/daemon/executor.rs` that apply the changes atomically in a single WAL mutation, validating label formats and parent existence.\n- Update CLI `label` commands to call the new label ops; update `update` to call `SetParent` when `--parent/--no-parent` is provided.\n- Keep response payloads consistent (use `OpResult::Updated` or add a small label/parent result if needed for clarity).\n\n**Design Notes**\nThis keeps CLI thin and centralizes behavior in the daemon. It also avoids subtle races (labels changed between fetch and update) and makes parent updates atomic.\n\n**Acceptance**\n- [ ] CLI label add/remove no longer fetches issues; daemon applies label changes atomically.\n- [ ] Parent updates are handled by a dedicated daemon op; CLI no longer manipulates deps directly.\n- [ ] Label validation errors and missing parent errors remain user-friendly.\n- [ ] Run `codex review --uncommitted` (timeout 10m) and address findings.\n- [ ] Tests pass.\n\n**Files:** `src/daemon/ipc.rs`, `src/daemon/ops.rs`, `src/daemon/executor.rs`, `src/cli/commands/label.rs`, `src/cli/commands/update.rs`, `src/api/mod.rs`","id":"bd-omw.3","labels":{"cc":{"max":{}},"entries":{}},"priority":2,"status":"closed","title":"Move label/parent updates into daemon ops","type":"chore"}
