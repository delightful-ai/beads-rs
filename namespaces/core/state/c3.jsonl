Current `build_snapshot` in `src/git/checkpoint/export.rs` sets `dirty_shards = all shards`, and `GitWorker::publish_checkpoint` always calls `export_checkpoint(previous=None)`, so every checkpoint is a full re‑export with no reuse.\n\n**Design**\n- Track dirty shard IDs in `StoreRuntime` using `ApplyOutcome` (beads/tombstones/deps) and pass them into `CheckpointSnapshot` instead of defaulting to all.\n- Retain the last export per group (or load from cache) and pass `previous: Some(&export)` to `export_checkpoint` so unchanged shard files are reused.\n- Ensure dirty shards are cleared only after successful publish.\n\n**Acceptance**\n- [ ] Dirty shards are tracked per namespace and carried into checkpoint snapshots.\n- [ ] `export_checkpoint` reuses previous files for clean shards.\n- [ ] Checkpoint export tests cover dirty‑only updates and reuse behavior.\n\n**Files:** src/daemon/store_runtime.rs, src/daemon/core.rs, src/daemon/checkpoint_scheduler.rs, src/daemon/git_worker.rs, src/git/checkpoint/export.rs","id":"bd-3m5.102","labels":{"cc":{"max":{}},"entries":{}},"priority":2,"status":"closed","title":"Checkpoint export always full; dirty shard tracking + previous reuse missing","type":"bug"}
