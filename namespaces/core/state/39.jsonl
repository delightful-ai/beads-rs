The trace shows pending ingest can start ahead of the next expected seq:\n- DeliverEvent(3)\n- DeliverEvent(2)\n- DeliverEvent(1)\n- CoordinatorIngest\n- DeliverEvent(1)\n- DeliverEvent(2)\n- DeliverAck\n\nThis indicates either the model invariant is wrong or the coordinator boundary logic allows a gap to slip through.\n\n**Design**\nInspect `beads_stateright_models/examples/session_coordinator_boundary.rs` and the underlying boundary logic. Confirm the intended rule (pending ingest should start at next expected, not beyond). If the rule is intended, adjust the model and/or coordinator state machine so it enforces contiguity when ingesting pending events. Add a regression test in the beads runtime to mirror the counterexample trace once the implementation exists (or add a model-only regression property if implementation work is not yet wired).\n\n**Acceptance**\n- [ ] Model check passes without the \"pending ingest starts at next expected\" counterexample.\n- [ ] If rule is intended, coordinator boundary enforces contiguity (no ingest beyond next expected).\n- [ ] Regression test added for the counterexample trace (model or implementation).\n\n**Files:** beads_stateright_models/examples/session_coordinator_boundary.rs","id":"bd-qsk","labels":{"cc":{"max":{}},"entries":{}},"priority":2,"status":"closed","title":"Stateright model: pending ingest contiguity counterexample","type":"bug"}
