Fetch errors are also ignored, so the daemon can sync against stale remote state without any signal.\n\n**Design**\nUse an explicit refspec (`refs/heads/beads/store:refs/remotes/origin/beads/store`) and return/propagate fetch errors (or at least surface them in status/IPC). Keep a best-effort path for offline reads but make failures visible.\n\n**Acceptance**\n- [ ] Fetch updates `refs/remotes/origin/beads/store`\n- [ ] Fetch errors are surfaced (status/IPC/logs)\n- [ ] Tests cover refspec + fetch failure behavior\n\n**Files:** src/git/sync.rs, src/daemon/git_worker.rs","id":"bd-v9i","labels":{"cc":{"max":{}},"entries":{}},"priority":1,"status":"closed","title":"Git fetch should use explicit refspec + surface errors","type":"bug"}
