This duplication adds surface area without benefit and makes it harder to reason about which path is authoritative.\n\n**Design**\nSimplify the IPC/ops surface by removing unused conversion helpers:\n- Audit call sites to confirm `BeadOp` and `Request::to_op`/`to_query` are unused outside tests.\n- Remove `Request::to_op`/`to_query` and the `BeadOp` type if unused; update tests accordingly.\n- If external API concerns exist, replace with a small internal helper or mark the methods `#[deprecated]` and keep a single authoritative path (`handle_request`).\n\n**Design Notes**\nGoal is to reduce duplication and keep one clear entry point for validation and parsing.\n\n**Acceptance**\n- [ ] Unused `BeadOp`/`Request::to_op`/`to_query` code is removed or deprecated with no functional change.\n- [ ] IPC request handling continues to use a single authoritative parsing path.\n- [ ] Run `codex review --uncommitted` (timeout 10m) and address findings.\n- [ ] Tests pass.\n\n**Files:** `src/daemon/ipc.rs`, `src/daemon/ops.rs`, `src/daemon/core.rs`","id":"bd-omw.6","labels":[],"priority":3,"status":"closed","title":"Remove unused BeadOp / Request::to_op duplication","type":"chore"}
