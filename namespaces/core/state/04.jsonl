Current metrics are only in-memory snapshots + tracing events.\n\n**Design**\n- Add a local observability store (SQLite) for metrics time‑series (and optionally log metadata) under `<data_dir>/obs/obs.db`.\n- Record metrics events with timestamp + labels; expose an admin query to fetch ranges.\n- Keep storage bounded (retention by time or max rows).\n- Optional: store log index/metadata (not full messages) for quick filtering.\n\n**Acceptance**\n- [ ] Metrics time‑series are persisted locally and queryable via admin API/CLI.\n- [ ] Storage is bounded via retention config.\n- [ ] Works offline; no external service required.\n\n**Files:** src/daemon/metrics.rs, src/daemon/admin.rs, src/api/admin.rs, src/cli/commands/admin.rs, src/paths.rs","id":"bd-riqc","labels":{"cc":{"max":{}},"entries":{}},"priority":2,"status":"closed","title":"Observability: local metrics store (SQLite)","type":"feature"}
