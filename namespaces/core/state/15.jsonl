Current workaround requires creating a placeholder bead and adding deps to every child of an epic individually.\n\n**Design**\nAdd `bd defer` and `bd undefer` commands:\n\n```bash\nbd defer bd-xyz                    # hide from ready\nbd defer bd-xyz --until 2026-03-01 # auto-undefer on date\nbd defer bd-xyz --cascade          # also defer all children (via parent relationship)\nbd undefer bd-xyz                  # bring back to ready\nbd list --deferred                 # see what's deferred\n```\n\nImplementation options:\n1. **New field**: Add `deferred: Option<WallClock>` to bead fields (LWW). `bd ready` filters these out.\n2. **Special label**: Use a reserved label like `@deferred` that `bd ready` excludes.\n3. **Synthetic blocker**: Auto-create/manage placeholder blockers (current manual workaround, automated).\n\nOption 1 is cleanest - explicit field, clear semantics, supports expiry dates.\n\n**Acceptance**\n- [ ] `bd defer <id>` hides bead from `bd ready`\n- [ ] `bd defer <id> --cascade` defers all children via parent relationship\n- [ ] `bd defer <id> --until <date>` auto-undefers on that date\n- [ ] `bd undefer <id>` brings bead back\n- [ ] `bd list --deferred` shows deferred beads\n- [ ] `bd show` indicates deferred status\n\n**Files:**\n- `crates/beads-core/src/bead.rs` (add deferred field)\n- `crates/beads-rs/src/cli/commands/defer.rs` (new command)\n- `crates/beads-rs/src/daemon/query_executor.rs` (filter in ready query)","id":"bd-7dc5","labels":{"cc":{"max":{}},"entries":{}},"priority":3,"status":"open","title":"Add bd defer/undefer commands for hiding beads from ready","type":"feature"}
