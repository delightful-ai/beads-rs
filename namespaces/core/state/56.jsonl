Corrupted WAL or merge conflicts can silently drop unsynced data.\n\n**Design**\nTreat WAL read/merge failures as fatal for load: return an OpError that surfaces the WAL issue, keep the WAL file intact, and avoid overwriting state with stale git data. Add a test that injects a corrupted WAL and asserts load returns an error.\n\n**Acceptance**\n- [ ] WAL read errors are returned to the caller (no silent ignore)\n- [ ] WAL merge conflicts return a structured error\n- [ ] WAL file is preserved on error\n- [ ] Tests cover corrupted WAL and merge failure paths\n- [ ] Tests pass\n\n**Files:** src/daemon/core.rs, src/daemon/wal.rs, src/daemon/ops.rs","id":"bd-qcz","labels":{"cc":{"max":{}},"entries":{}},"priority":0,"status":"closed","title":"WAL read/merge failures must not be ignored","type":"bug"}
