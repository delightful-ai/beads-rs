The gap buffer never promotes deferred events after durable advances, so those events can remain stuck and trigger unnecessary WANTs even though we already received them.\n\n**Evidence**\n- src/daemon/repl/session.rs: handle_events() computes expected_prev via expected_prev_head() using the durable watermark snapshot (not updated per-frame).\n- src/core/event.rs: verify_event_frame() returns VerifiedEventAny::Deferred when expected_prev_head is None for seq>1.\n- src/daemon/repl/gap_buffer.rs: ingest_one() buffers deferred events and advance_durable_batch() does not re-check buffered deferred events.\n\n**Why this hurts**\nA peer that legitimately batches seq N and N+1 in a single EVENTS frame will cause seq N+1 to be buffered and never applied unless it is resent later.

Call it after advance_durable_batch().\n\nWhichever approach, ensure events already in the batch are not re-requested via WANT.","id":"bd-8y9","labels":{"cc":{"max":{}},"entries":{}},"priority":1,"status":"closed","title":"Replication ingest can stall on contiguous batches","type":"bug"}
