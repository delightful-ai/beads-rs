There's no explicit detection or warning to the user.\n\n**Design**\nDetect non-ancestor relationships between local/remote refs and surface a structured warning/error (e.g., status payload includes `diverged=true`). Consider requiring manual `bd sync --force` for history rewrites.\n\n**Acceptance**\n- [ ] Divergence detection is explicit\n- [ ] User-visible warning surfaced (status/IPC)\n- [ ] Tests cover force-push/divergence scenario\n\n**Files:** src/git/sync.rs, src/daemon/core.rs, src/api/mod.rs","id":"bd-0l1","labels":{"cc":{"max":{}},"entries":{}},"priority":1,"status":"closed","title":"Detect and surface remote force-push/divergence","type":"bug"}
