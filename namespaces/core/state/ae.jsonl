The data exists in API but is hidden in CLI.\n\n**Design**\nExtend render_admin_status in src/cli/render.rs to print applied/durable watermarks per namespace/origin in a deterministic order. Keep formatting concise (namespace -> origin -> seq, head state optional). Add a focused unit test for the new formatting.\n\n**Files**\n- src/cli/render.rs","id":"bd-rcu","labels":{"cc":{"max":{}},"entries":{}},"priority":2,"status":"closed","title":"Show applied/durable watermarks in admin status CLI output","type":"feature"}
